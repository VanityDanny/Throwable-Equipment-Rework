Right now, the grenades aren't a threat. They are very easy to avoid and noobs only start throwing them when they are about to die. <br>
Here is my idea on how they can be reworked. When you press G, you’ll have the grenade in your hand. You click left mouse to unpin. When unpinned, it takes 5 seconds to explode. If you hold the left mouse, you’ll see a curved white dotted line with a circle at the end showing the trajectory of the grenade you will toss and where it will land. Move your mouse to choose the distance on how far the grenade will go and release the left mouse to throw. If you left click and not hold, you will roll the grenade, which is for when throwing isn’t needed. <br>
You got 5 seconds to do this. Holding the unpinned grenade for 5 seconds will get yourself killed. If the grenade on the floor is touched by a player or vehicle before 5 seconds, it will detonate.</br>
